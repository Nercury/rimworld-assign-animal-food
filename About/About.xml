	<description>Assign food restrictions to animals.

This mod contains identical functionality from both "Animal Food Restrictions" and "AnimalFoodRestrictionInTab", so they are not needed when this mod is loaded.

Features from the mods above:

- Player-owned animals respect food restrictions
- A new column appears in Animal tab to manage restrictions
- Compatible with "Animal Tab"

New features:

- New "Animal" restriction will be automatically created for a new game or existing save    
- All newly tamed or acquired animals will have "Animal" restriction assigned to them
- Birthed animals acquire parent's food restriction
- Hatched birds acquire egg parent's food restriction (when eggs are in a stack, a single parent is assigned to the whole stack though)
- You can rename "Animal" restriction, and it will still work
- You can delete "Animal" restriction, but to restore default assignment you will need to create a new restriction named "Animal", and then save and reload the game
