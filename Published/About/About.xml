	<description>Assign food restrictions to animals.

- A new "Animal" restriction will be assigned to colony animals
- A new column appears in Animal tab to manage restrictions
- Animals will inherit food restriction from parents

This mod was simplified a lot for Rimworld 1.4. It does one thing only and should be easy to understand.

Some common caveats:

- Animals will respect food restriction on caravans. Maybe it's a good idea to create a separate restriction for traveling so that animals don't starve to death.

Compatibility:

- Works with Animal Tab
- If using the Numbers mod, don't forget to add a food restriction column, if you use Numbers option to take over Animals tab.
- Mod can be enabled/disabled.
- The mod does not modify food filter hierarchy at all, so it should be compatible with mods that do.

What was removed in 1.4 (these features still available if you load mod for 1.3):

- Preventing animals from eating drugs, because my quick test with a starving donkey in a closed room showed that the donkey does not want to eat ambrosia.
- There was an option to prevent animals from eating food in areas designated to cut. Due to the changes in Rimworld internals (seems to be performance-related), the option was cut.
